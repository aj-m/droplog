# Droplog
Keeps track of all the drops of the Redditors clan on RuneScape

## How it works
It's a very small/simple script. It has a hardcoded list of names (yeah I know Kappa) and 
it pulls the Adventure Log RSS Feed for those people. Once it has the last 10 entries for that person
(this is the limit Jagex keeps), it filters out all the logs with the word 'found' in it.

After displaying the logs, there is some post-processing like sorting on date and adding highlight
borders to special drops.

For the newbs, the main code is under the 'js' folder.
